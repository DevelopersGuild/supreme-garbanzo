# De Anza Remote Club Meetings

This site lists clubs at De Anza & Foothill that have an excellent remote presence you can use to find groups to meet with that share common hobbies and interests. It has been easy to fall into asocial patterns and hard for some of us to connect with others. We hope you can find something exciting and engaging. We have gone out of our way to contact and allow clubs to change the list with relevant information.
